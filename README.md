# About me
I am a student of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence currently enrolled in a Bachelor's Degree. I am interested in Machine Learning, Database and Systems engineering, and I 
wish to actively contribute in AI Research Project, and to create creative, simple and elegant software, so that the people who use it will benefit from it. I love learning new theories,
skills, and concepts; I would like to continue doing so as long as I dwell on this beautiful planet.
